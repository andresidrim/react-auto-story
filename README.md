# react-auto-story

**react-auto-story** is a CLI tool that automatically generates Storybook `.stories.tsx` files for your React components based on an `@auto-story` annotation.

Useful for teams who want to streamline Storybook integration with minimal manual setup in React projects.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Detects annotated components in your React project
- Automatically creates clean `.stories.tsx` files
- Works with both named and default exports
- Outputs stories to a structured `src/stories/` folder
- Smart import paths and customizable title generation
- Supports global args, variants, and flag-based customization

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g react-auto-story
```

or with PNPM:

```bash
pnpm add -g react-auto-story
```

Alternatively, you can use it directly with `npx` (no install required):

```bash
npx react-auto-story
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

From your project root, simply run:

```bash
react-auto-story
```

Then follow the interactive prompts to:

- Choose the base folder (e.g. `src`)
- Select which components to generate stories for
- Choose where to save the generated files (e.g. `src/stories`)

---

## üß† Mark your components

Only components explicitly marked with `@auto-story` will be picked up.

```tsx
// @auto-story
export function Button() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}
```

Or:

```tsx
/*
@auto-story
--global-args: {
  children: "Click me"
}
--Default-args: {
  variant: "primary"
}
--variant Secondary
--Secondary-args: {
  variant: "secondary"
}
*/
export default function Button() {
  return <button />;
}
```

---

## üóÇ Output structure

Your stories will be created in:

```
src/stories/[relative-folder]/[Component].stories.tsx
```

For example:

```
src/components/atoms/Button.tsx ‚Üí src/stories/atoms/Button.stories.tsx
```

---

## üè∑ Supported Flags

Inside the `@auto-story` comment, you can use the following flags:

| Flag               | Description                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `--global-args`    | Sets the `args` on the default export       |
| `--Default-args`   | Sets the `args` for the `Default` story     |
| `--variant [Name]` | Declares a named story variant              |
| `--[Name]-args`    | Provides `args` for the named variant       |
| `--no-default`     | Skips the generation of the `Default` story |

All args must be in valid JavaScript object format (`{ key: "value" }`).

---

## ‚öô Configuration

Currently, the CLI assumes:

- Your source code is inside the `src/` folder
- Components are located in folders like `components/atoms/...`
- Output stories are placed in `src/stories`, preserving substructure

You can customize paths by editing the CLI source or contributing to the project.
